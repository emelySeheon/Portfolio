In Fall 2023, I took Software Engineering, a class focused on putting students in an environment similar to that of a real workplace. The coursework was heavy on teamwork, deliverables, management, documentation, and organization. We had two projects in this course:
Home Safe: For this project we were tasked to design and implement a simulation of a home safe. We had to consider many things, including protection against criminals, fires, water, movement, etc.
Voting System: For this project we were tasked to choose a U.S. state and implement a voting system that matched the state's laws. This project involved researching the state, which our group chose to be Ohio, and looking deeply into their voting laws.
