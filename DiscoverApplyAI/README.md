AI4ALL is a program that teaches college students about AI and how it works. I took their two classes - Discover AI and Apply AI after that. My group's project for Discover AI Project involved analyzing crime rates in Boston, and our project for Apply AI was using computer vision to find patterns in the x-rays of pneumonia patients. Through this class, I learned a lot about different machine-learning algorithms and what they are best used for.
