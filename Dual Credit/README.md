These are the programs I made while I was taking dual credit classes at Central New Mexico Community College (CNM)[https://www.cnm.edu/] while in high school. C++, Java, and Python were my first programming languages, and these are the projects that led me to fall in love with coding. These projects include a treasure hunt (Python Final Project), the Game of Life (C++ II Project 8), an SQL project (Java II Final Project), C++ GUIs (C++ II Projects 5 and 6), and more!
