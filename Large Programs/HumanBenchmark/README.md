HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM

Entry point is Home.java

Run the program as usual, no command line arguments are needed.

To quit the program, push the quit option. You will be given the choice to save the results of your game. If you choose
to save them, they will go to a .csv file in the resources folder of the project and the program will close. This
saves only the most recent score of each game. Otherwise, the program will simply close.

KNOWN ISSUES

-IntelliJ tells me that my ColorPicker.java class has 12 errors on line 30, however the program complies and runs fine
as it is supposed to. I am not sure if this will be a problem for anyone else using the program. I have tried getting
rid of the errors, but as far as I can tell the syntax is fine and they seem to have no specific cause.
