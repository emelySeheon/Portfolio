HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM

.Entry point is Main.java

.Run the program as usual, no command line arguments are needed.

.In the Program:

-Use the "Start"/"Stop" buttons to start and stop the automatic animation

-If you would like to change any of the values, make sure the animation is first stopped.

-The "Increment by" text field allows you to change the difference between the "Multiplied by" value between each step.

-The "Delayed by" text field allows you to change the time between each step.

-The "Multiplied by" text field allows you to change the starting point multiplication value in the animation.

-The "Number of Points" text field allows you to change the number of points around the circle.

-The "Jump to" text field allows you to jump to a certain "Multiplied by" value to view it. You may also change the

number of points to jump to a specific value with a specific number of points. After you have entered the desired

values, push the "Jump to" button to go to that circle.

-The "Favorites" selector is a list of my personal favorite "Multiplied by" values. Select one of the values. You may

also change the number of points to jump to a specific value with a specific number of points.
