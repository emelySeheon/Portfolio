In Spring 2023, I took Design of Large Programs, a class designed to teach students how to properly organize large coding projects. Here are the projects in order:
Modulo Times tables in a circle: Our project was to create a program to replicate this video.
Human Benchmark: Our project was to create a program where a user could play the games shown on this website, and save their scores if they choose. 
Dominoes: Our project here was to program a game of dominoes against a computer. I made a GUI version of this game as well as a terminal version.
Assembly Silos: This was our first group project, we were tasked with recreating the game TIS-100.
Bank Auction: Also a group project, we needed to create a system of banks, auction houses, and buyers that would work on a server such that it could be used from multiple computers.
