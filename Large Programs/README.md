In Spring 2023, I took [Design of Large Programs](https://catalog.unm.edu/catalogs/2021-2022/courses/CS/351L.html#:~:text=A%20projects%20course%20with%20emphasis,oriented%20analysis%2C%20design%20and%20programming.), a class designed to teach students how to properly organize large coding projects. Here are the projects in order:
- Modulo Times tables in a circle: Our project was to create a program to replicate [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhbuKbxJsk8).
- Human Benchmark: Our project was to create a program where a user could play the games shown on [this website](https://humanbenchmark.com/), and save their scores if they choose.
- Dominoes: Our project here was to program a game of dominoes against a computer. I made a GUI version of this game as well as a terminal version.
- Assembly Silos: This was our first group project, we were tasked with recreating the game [TIS-100](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/).
- Bank Auction: Also a group project, we needed to create a system of banks, auction houses, and buyers that would work on a server such that it could be used from multiple computers.
