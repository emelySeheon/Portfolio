In Spring 2023, I took an Autonomous Mobile Robots class. For the class, I had to come up with an idea for a robot and make it. My idea was an assistant robot. The first part was to use computer vision to have the robot follow a person. Next, I would connect it to a large language model such as ChatGPT such that, using voice recognition, a user could ask the robot a question and the robot would be able to answer it. For the scope of the class, I completed the first part of the project. I plan to continue working on it. See my project website [here](https://sites.google.com/view/assistantrobot/home).
